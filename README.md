## Overview

Celestial is a mode designed to add difficult to obtain items, similar to creative items
however they were designed to be used in survival, just without balancing for this. This
mod adds items that are not balanced and has little though about the player being limited
to there mortal body.

## Features

- Celestial Armor (Armor that lets you pass though blocks, similar to spectator)
- Teleport to different locations, (Coordinates / Waypoints)
- Bow to destroy enemies or bases
- Item Binding to prevent others from using stolen items (if you can even kill / steal
  them)
